You want something in your career. What is it? Advancement in specific skills?
Bigger problems to solve or bigger teams to lead? Occasion to showcase your
unique talents? The chance to work with specific people you look up to, and to
learn from them?

No matter what your *ambition*, your ability to achieve it is built from two
parts: your resolve, which is your capacity to do the things you must do; and
your environment, or the presence of opportunity.

I call this the "ambition to opportunity ratio."<!--more-->

Let's talk about how to achieve your wildest dreams.

## Craft an ambition

Some people already have a vision for themselves, in their careers and/or
lives, but I think the majority of people have not truly *crafted* an ambition.

So, what does it mean to craft your ambition? First, it must be *yours*, which
means you didn't simply accept an ambition that someone else told you to
have. Are you working to get promoted, or preparing to interview for a bigger
role at a new company? Is that what you really want, or are you seeking a title
bump because that's what we're told we're *supposed to do*?

## Build an environment





Or aspiration vs. opportunity.

A topic that you could discuss with your manager, or your coach. What is your
personal growth or career vision?

Questions to ask:

1. Is your vision big enough?

   Your vision should be SCARY BIG. It is more inspirational to others who may
   be able to help you if your vision is something a little bit frightening.

2. How is your vision aligned to your values?

   A really ambition vision will only be achievable if it's along a path of your
   values in action. If achieving your ambition requires sacrificing things that
   are very important to you, you're telling yourself a lie.

   Some example here could be... If you wish to attain a very high level of
   seniority, it is likely that you'll have to prioritize work over other things
   in your life. If one of your values is balance among those things, you're
   unlikely to achieve your stated goal.

3. What is the biggest (meaningful), smallest (clear and achievable) thing you
   can do to get closer to your goal?

   The important question is: can you see exactly how to lean into that next
   step in your current environment? If your growth vision is to help as many
   people as you can achieve the next step in their technical careers, and
   everyone you work with is at your experience level or higher, you have no
   opportunity to grow people in the way you dream.

   Either change your dream, or change your environment.
