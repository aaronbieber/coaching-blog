This comic from "marketoonist.com" showed up on LinkedIn somewhere and made me
laugh. It depicts one person boasting about using AI to expand a single bullet
point into a lengthy email, and another person boasting about using AI to
condense a long email into a single bullet point.

I think the reason this is funny is because it's just possible enough to be
believable, though it's also ridiculous when presented in such a transparent
way. Let's dig into what we can learn from it.
