I have had trouble asking for help for nearly my entire life. I don't know when
it started or what caused it, but at some point in my childhood I learned that
knowing correct answers is rewarded, and asking for help is admitting that you
don't have the correct answer.

That simple idea led me to perpetrate, quite literally, decades of
self-sabotage. Rather than ask a question or offer a guess, I just kept my mouth
shut. <!--more-->

This behavior produced two outcomes for me:

1. Most of the kids in my classes thought I was really smart, because I only
   raised my hand when I definitely knew the answer. Few people saw me screw up.
   
2. I robbed myself of learning experiences, which is bad enough, but I also
   missed opportunities to give someone else the gift of helping me.
   
Fortunately, I have learned this about myself, so I can begin to fix it (and I'm
a lot better now about asking for help when I know I really need it), but asking
for help can be hard even for someone without a pathological fear of being
wrong.

I want to share some ideas for how to overcome that reluctance when it strikes.

## You are not alone

Jean Hsu, engineer, coach, and co-founder of "Co Leadership," used to
run workshops for engineering leaders, and in those workshops they'd ask
attendees why they may have trouble asking for help.

Some of the reasons included:

 - People will think I’m stupid
 - They’re too busy
 - They’ll be annoyed
 - I should know this already

Straight away, you should feel reassured that if you have had any of those
thoughts before, you're not the first person to have them, and you most
assuredly will not be the last.
 
In poll of over 2,000 adults administered by CivicScience, 74% said
they ask for help "at home, at work, at a store, traveling, or online." Compare
that to only 41% who responded that they ask for help *specifically while at
work*.

https://civicscience.com/asking-for-help-may-be-a-privilege/

That discrepancy is enormous! Three out of four Americans are comfortable asking
for help in most situations, yet almost *two thirds* are not comfortable asking
for help at work.

It's hard to ask for help.

## This might help you ask for help

Here's the thing: people *like* to be helpful.

Think about a time when someone asked *you* for help. Actually imagine a
specific time. How did it feel to be asked for help? Did it make you feel
knowledgeable, trustworthy, or responsible?

I bet it made you feel pretty good. Even if there is a perceived knowledge
imbalance (for instance, if you are an Engineer II and you are approached for
help by a Staff Engineer) you probably feel even *more flattered* to be asked *by
them*. Having an opportunity to demonstrate our value, and to be of service to
others, is consistently linked to sustained happiness.

Heidi Grant, social psychologist and author of "[Reinforcements: How to Get
People to Help You][rein]," says, "Human beings are basically wired to want to give
help. It’s one of the richest sources of self-esteem, and it has the potential
to be a real win-win. Helping is rewarding for people because they like to be
supportive and connect with other people."

Here are a couple additional tips from Grant:

1. Ask. Our need for help is simply not obvious to others, so make it clear that
   you want help.
   
2. Be direct and explicit. Don't ask to "pick their brain," or "to chat," ask
   for what you specifically need.
   
3. Ask a specific person, or specific people individually. If you pose the
   request to a group, you're less likely to get help due to what psychologists
   call "diffusion of responsibility," which is where group members all assume
   that someone else will help you.
   
4. Don't use manipulative tactics, or lead with "can you do me a favor?". Don't
   apologize for asking. People want to help you, but they want to feel that it
   was their *informed decision*, and nobody wants to feel like they're helping
   out of pity.

## A challenge

What have we learned? *Most people* are reluctant to ask for help at work. But,
ironically, people love helping other people. If you ask someone directly, the
chances are good that they'll help you *and* that they'll enjoy it.

In the next week, when you have a need for help, no matter how trivial, ask
someone. Take note of what it feels like to ask, and what the outcome is.

Do you have stories about asking for help? I'd love to hear them (seriously!)
You can always comment or write to me directly.
