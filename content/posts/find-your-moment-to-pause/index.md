If you don't recognize that symbol to the right, you are (perhaps) among the
lucky few. The icon is the "message waiting" indicator for the very popular
workplace collaboration tool Slack, and it's been slowly killing me.

This isn't going to be a condemnation of Slack, though. Rather, I want to talk
about the hyper-responsive world that we've built around us, and how it quietly
erodes your focus, and what you can do to counter it.

## The woman with no cell phone

For several years in my 20s, I lived in a small city, within walking distance to
shops, restaurants, bars, and the water. I was soon a regular at one particular
family-owned restaurant.

I got to know the owner pretty well over the years, and we talked often. During
one of those chats, it came out that she didn't have a cell phone. Not even a
flip phone; no cell phone at all! In 2008! Apple sold *ten million iPhones*
in 2008.

I recall asking her, *What if someone needs to reach you?* She explained that
she's usually at home or at the restaurant, so people can call her there, and if
she's somewhere else, they can leave a message.

*They can leave a message?!*

## The spiral of expectations

When any new communications tech comes out, which makes a new responsiveness
possible, adopting that new level of responsiveness can be a signal that we send
to our friends, family, and coworkers about how dedicated we are. But, as UC
Irvine professor Melissa Mazmanian wrote, the opposite becomes true: *not*
adopting that new responsiveness might signal that we aren't *dedicated enough*.

Mazmanian termed this the "spiral of expectations." The response time that
society demands gets ever shorter, and as a result, we lose our ability to
*simply be*.

I frequently, compulsively glance down at the Slack icon to see if it has a red
dot. Yes, I have notifications snoozed most of the time, but even then there is
a part of my brain saying *what if someone needs me?*

It is like I am *in search of* some reason to not be doing what I'm already
doing, and when I think about it that way, it's *pretty messed up*.

This is what the constant-notifications culture has done to me; it has made me a
slave to that little dot. Because I want to be responsive, I want to be
*responsible*. I want people to like and trust me.

My friend the restaurant-owner with no cell phone beat the system by simply *not
adopting* the new technology. To 26-year-old me, it made no sense. Why would
anyone want to be *less connected*?

But now I realize that she made the right call: to preserve her attention, that
priceless and limited resource, for only what *she* chose. How freeing.

## Be free, for a while

I challenge you to disconnect for one hour, **today**. To live free from
notifications, and especially, free from expectations. I'm giving you permission
to pick an hour, or two, or more, and simply *rest*.

This doesn't mean that you must *do nothing*, although I fully support spending
some time *in purposeful boredom*. You could take a walk, read a book, draw a
picture, play an instrument. The important part is that you do this *without
distraction* and *without guilt*. Leave your phone somewhere else.

## Let me know how it goes

I want to hear your stories of living a distraction-free hour (or more). You can
comment on this post on the web, or reply directly to the email if you received
it in my newsletter, or DM me on Twitter ([@aaronbieber][tweet]).
