Over the last year or so working at my corporate job, I'd often get up in the
morning and look at my work calendar with a sense of dread. I spent hours and
hours every week doing "important" and "necessary" activities that, to me,
created no value at all for the world. I'd end the day feeling mentally and
emotionally drained.

It's clear to me from my work with engineering leaders that a feeling of
contentment or joy in a senior management role is far from guaranteed. In fact,
it's typical for a rise in seniority to be accompanied by an apparent decrease
in contentment.

There is no single reason for why this happens that applies to everyone, but
there is one key factor that predicts how happy you'll be in your job overall,
regardless of seniority.

If you understand this one incredibly simple thing, you can guarantee job
satisfaction forever.<!--more-->

The reason why engineering leaders experience this decreasing joy phenomenon is
commonly that our early-career joy was tied to our *work* rather than to our
*job*. We started as individual contributors, and we were excited to *just write
code*. The work itself was fun, challenging, gratifying.

As we take on more management responsibilities, typically our time spent
doing those *intrinsically joyful tasks* decreases, and our fundamental role
changes in character. For a while, the new challenge of solving "people
problems" and learning new skills creates equal gratification.

Finally, leaders split into two groups: the folks who discover that they also
*intrinsically love* the tasks of management, and the folks who move beyond its
novelty and end up missing the programming work and who find no other source of
gratification in carrying it out.

But there's a shortcut around all of this, a way to maintain happiness and
gratification no matter how mundane your daily tasks.

I'll tell you a secret: you don't need to love your *work* to love your
*job*. Furthermore, there are tons of people out there who often love their work
and yet are still *perpetually dissatisfied* with their jobs.

Why is that?

Mainly it is because many people end up with their personal happiness tied up in
their achievements. Certainly achieving things is great, but it isn't a good
idea to base your happiness on achievement, and I'll tell you why.

News flash: you don't control your outcomes.

No matter how hard you work at something, some part of its success is entirely
out of your control. It might be colleagues' performance, market dynamics, or
dumb luck, but you don't hold all the cards.

Even when you do bank a win, the "glow" of that success 
[doesn't last very long]({{< ref "the-when-then-trap" >}}).

You used to get that rush from coding, then for a while it came from the novelty
of figuring out how humans interact and how teams create leverage, and then it
came from the recognition of promotions into higher levels of leadership.

But if you want happiness to last, it has to come from somewhere else entirely.

Safi Bahcall, famed physicist, technologist, executive, and author discovered
this, and the way he said it is lovely:

What a perfectly scientific way to put it. You can achieve, and you can be
happy, but if you think the two are connected you've got it wrong.

Alright, so where does happiness come from, then? If you've read anything by
Daniel Pink or Simon Sinek, this won't be surprising to you: it comes from
purpose.

Consider this brief excerpt from [Start With Why](https://amzn.to/3B8n9cU):

> Consider the story of two stonemasons. You walk up to the first stonemason and
> ask, “Do you like your job?” He looks up at you and replies, “I’ve been building
> this wall for as long as I can remember. The work is monotonous. I work in the
> scorching hot sun all day. The stones are heavy and lifting them day after day
> can be backbreaking. I’m not even sure if this project will be completed in my
> lifetime. But it’s a job. It pays the bills.” You thank him for his time and
> walk on. 
> 
> About thirty feet away, you walk up to a second stonemason. You ask him the same
> question, “Do you like your job?” He looks up and replies, “I love my job. I’m
> building a cathedral. Sure, I’ve been working on this wall for as long as I can
> remember, and yes, the work is sometimes monotonous. I work in the scorching hot
> sun all day. The stones are heavy and lifting them day after day can be

The *work* is less important to happiness than whether you think the *job* is
worthwhile. If the job is worthwhile, if it's noble, if it aligns to what you
feel is important (no matter what that is), the work can be anything.

## Ask yourself these two questions

### "What are my gifts to the world?"

Note: this does not mean "what do you do very well," but rather what are the
things that you intrinsically, automatically create? What is added when you show
up in the room?

For me, it's curiosity, optimism, and thoughtfulness. With no effort, I bring
those qualities into every interaction.

### "What is your purpose?"

Imagine that you are on stage, moments from presenting to a sold-out
audience. They have all come to learn from you and your experience. What is
the *one thing* that you want to teach this audience?

That one thing is, or is somehow connected to, your purpose.

For me, it's the concept that *curiosity enriches life*, and I want to help
everyone to discover this. If I can help someone to get more curious for even
five seconds, and have one of those "huh..." moments, *it makes my day*.

Find a *job* that puts your gifts on offer and serves your purpose and I promise
that you will find truly durable happiness there.
