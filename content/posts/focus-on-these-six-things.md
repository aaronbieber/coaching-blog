title: Focus on these six things

The computer and information technology sector is projected to grow
faster than **any other occupation** over the next ten years.

As more and more people enter the field, the need for management grows,
too. The software engineering field is notoriously fickle about hiring
"outside managers," and for good reason; research shows that the most
effective managers not only *understand* the work of their teams, but
can *actually do the work,* too.

Maybe you're one of those managers, pulled from the halcyon ranks of
your programmer peers. Maybe your own manager felt the overwhelm of too
many people to manage. Maybe you wanted to take a swing at this "soft
skills" stuff people are always talking about. Maybe you just love a new
challenge. Maybe you've been doing this for a while and feel like you
have it figured out.

No matter your circumstance, managing software engineers is hard. The
job has changed a lot in the past couple of decades, too.

Gone are the days of "waterfall" project planning. Gone are the
micromanagers and stiff-necked authoritarians (well, mostly). Gone are
the patent leather shoes, the pantsuits, the horn-rimmed glasses. Okay,
horn-rimmed glasses never *really* went out of style.

Today's engineering managers are still responsible for the *work
product*, but the emphasis is so much more on *creating an environment
conducive to innovation*. Heavy wooden office doors and weekly status
reports have been replaced by open floor plans (ugh), group stand-ups,
and Trello boards.

What a software engineer needs from her manager today, more than
anything, is trust, support, and feedback, and to work with a team that
is actualized through thoughtful process and interaction design.

If you're ready to take your management to the next level, I have
created what I am calling "The Engineering Manager's Charter," which is
a set of **six simple principles** that embody what I believe is the key
set of behaviors anyone can learn and apply.

If you look closely, you can see where I was inspired by Google's
Project Oxygen and successful habits within Amazon among others.

## My score

I believe in transparency, and I believe that we can't make durable
connections as people unless we are able to be vulnerable. In that
spirit, I will share my score with you here.

I hope that this encourages you to be open with yourself about where you
stand, and to be open with your colleagues as well.

Everyone has areas to grow into. These are mine. I can definitely be
better at providing timely feedback, and I need to put some effort into
getting closer to the work so that I can help out in a more hands-on way
when needed.

On the positive side, I'm very good at applying coaching methods to
guide folks toward their own answers, I'm allergic to micromanagement,
and I think I'm a better than OK writer.

Keep in mind that these principles are "north star" goals, and are also
situational. While everyone would wish to have their scores steadily
creep upward until they're all 10s, it's more likely that they'll
fluctuate. Your work environment, your area(s) of focus, and feedback
you get from others all factor in.

For those reasons, check in with yourself regularly and think about how
you're doing in each area. Are you making the progress that you want to,
in the areas that are most important for right now?

If you want my help to remind you to check in, [subscribe to my
newsletter](https://aaronbieber.coach/subscribe)\!

## So now what?

Over the next few weeks, I am going to dive into each of the principles in
detail, right here in this blog (and the newsletter; [subscribe so you don't
miss anything](https://aaronbieber.coach/subscribe)\!) I'll give you practical
tips for measuring and improving, and explain what I'm going to do to work on
improving my own score.

This is as much about **learning** as it is about **sharing** for me,
and so I hope to hear from you if this is helpful, or not helpful, or if
you just want to tell me your story.
