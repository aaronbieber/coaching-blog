Do you make decisions intuitively or analytically?

What if I told you that analyzing your situation might be more of a waste of
time than you think? What if I told you that your intuition is actually a
massive window into your intelligence?

In fact, ignoring the importance of intuition almost destroyed the Coca-Cola
company.<!--more-->

You have a huge brain. Your brain is so big that you had to be born before it
was fully developed, or else your gigantic head wouldn't have made it thorough
your mother's birth canal. If we humans have one advantage over other species on
Earth, it's our giant brains.

Every second, our enormous brain is receiving tens of thousands of signals from
all of our senses. Those signals are mostly "processed" subconsciously, and some
small amount of them surface into our conscious awareness.

Your senses and intentions mingle with all of your memories and structured
knowledge and produce the outputs that you consciously perceive. One output is
coherent, semi-organized thoughts; the answers to questions, specific pieces of
information, and so forth.

When you recall a person's name, or consider how to do a math problem, those
"answers" that pop up in your head are the organized result of analysis.

But your coherent thoughts are only a small fraction of the output your
gargantuan brain has produced, and thousands of years of evolution has optimized
us to perceive the rest of what we "know" nearly instantaneously, as *intuition*.

Other names for intuition include "gut instinct" or "a hunch."

In the kingdom of tech, data and objectivity are the King and Queen, if you
will, and they are quick to dismiss a hunch. I don't suggest that you listen
*exclusively* to your gut instinct, but I do think that your gut can help you
more than you might realize... Just ask Coca-Cola president Donald Keough.

In the 1980s, Pepsi started the "Pepsi Challenge" campaign, which asked
customers to do blind taste tests of Pepsi and Coke. This campaign was a huge
success, and threatened Coke's leading position in the market.

Coca-Cola decided to run their own experiment so they performed blind taste
tests with around 190,000 people in the US and Canada. Unbelievably (to them),
people preferred the flavor of Pepsi! Executives were rattled, so they hatched a
plan.

In 1985, Chairman and CEO of the Coca-Cola Company, Roberto Goizueta, announced
that they had created a *new formula*, which they branded "New Coke."

Coca-Cola president Donald Keough described it as "the surest move ever made,"
adding "I've never been as confident about a decision as I am about the one
we're announcing today."

It was a bad move. Coca-Cola's stock tumbled, and upwards of 5,000 angry
customers were calling the company *every day* to complain. Coca-Cola had to
hire more phone staff to keep up.

Yet in the *analysis*, people *clearly* preferred the sweeter flavor of Pepsi
and New Coke. They had data on their side, they had objectivity on their
side. This product shouldn't have failed.

So why did it fail? And what does this have to do with intuition?

What Coca-Cola overlooked is *why people buy Coke in the first place*. Spoiler
alert: it's not (only) because of the flavor.

Yes, people *believe* they prefer one flavor over the other, but the only way to
reconcile the outcome of Coca-Cola's own large-scale taste test experiment and
the public's buying behavior is to recognize that people buy Coke because they
have what's called *brand affinity*.

Brand affinity is an example of a weakness of intuition: marketers expose you to
experiences (we call them "advertisements") that you later unconsciously
pattern-match, and which surface intuitively. Other weaknesses you may have
heard of include *prejudice* and *unconscious bias*.

Nevertheless, your intuition delivers mountains of data that you can *only
access* if you open your consciousness to recognize that hunch, that
indescribable sense, that *feeling in your gut*. Sometimes the answer is not
useful, and other times it is *extremely useful*.

Intuition is used to great effect by professional athletes, elite security
personnel, and even stockbrokers.

For instance, some pro tennis players can tell when their opponent will serve a
fault, but they can't tell you why. That subconscious message is the result of
their observations filtered through thousands of hours of experience.

Here's a trick for recognizing your intuitive sense, which we call "expansion
vs. contraction." When you consider an option, if you have a feeling of opening,
of possibilities, of abundance, then that is an intuitive "yes."

If instead you feel contraction, limitation, scarcity, or closing, that is an
intuitive "no."

Of course this is not the only way that your intuition can show up for you. You
might get flashes of color, or a feeling of warmth or cold in your chest, or
something else entirely. It's different for everyone. If you've had a unique
intuitive experience I'd love to hear about it.

Some questions for you:

* How does intuition show up for you?
* What can you do to be more open to your intuition every day?
* What is possible when you listen to your intuition?
