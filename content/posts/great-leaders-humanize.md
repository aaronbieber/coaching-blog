All companies beyond a certain size are sociopathic colony organisms that regard
their employees as inconvenient gut flora (to borrow an expression from
[Cory Doctorow][pluralistic]).

At some point in their growth, many companies consider whether to stack-rank
employees by their performance ratings; or publish management guidelines
referring to groups of humans as "[resources][resources]"; or undertake vast
re-orgs solely on the basis of metrics-based abstractions.

These efficiency- and profit-seeking behaviors will inevitably be suggested and
discussed, though they are universally dehumanizing to employees.

Your highest calling as a leader is to remember that your company requires
employees in order to function, that employees are humans, and that the only
thing that differentiates your company from an "immortal
[paperclip-maximizing][paperclip] artificial intelligence" is how you treat
them.

It's regrettably easy to slip into a pattern of dehumanizing behaviors, and the
tech industry is abundant with examples of this kind of bad leadership. Bad
leaders don't care how value is created, only that it is created, and
[created *quickly*][blitz]. Bad leaders put growth before all else, then end up 
with company "values" like "[super-pumpedness][pumped]," or a managerial seminar 
called "[wolf school][wolf]" where they teach managers to yell in each other's faces.

Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was martyred for presiding over the rampant abuses that
took place under his watch. His replacement, Dara Khosrowshahi, said of
Kalanick's now-infamous cultural norms, "As we move from an era of growth at all
costs to one of responsible growth, our culture needs to evolve."

In contrast, great leaders are always chasing more customer value, but a great
leader is not in it for themselves first. Great leaders create value by
maximizing employee growth and success. Building an organization that has
*taught itself how to thrive* is the only way to survive for the long term.
Simon Sinek calls it "[the infinite game][sinek]."

The crucial difference is looking at the people you work with as an *investment
in future possibility* rather than merely a cost center, or a fungible talent
pool to be strategically molded to the current business scenario.

It isn't hard to treat people who work for you like... Well, like people. What's
hard is remembering to do it when your day-to-day experience shifts toward more
and more Tableau dashboards and budget reports.

Cutting staff is easy when they're just dots on a scatter plot.

But there is a cost to overlooking the value of human connection and the crucial
importance of honest, transparent communication. When you fail to
[explain things carefully][explain], employees become less satisfied. The
University of Warwick, UK found that job satisfaction improved productivity by
12%.[^1] In their own internal experiments, Google found that number to be more
like 37%.

It's not just about productivity, either. About 75% of employees who report
being unsatisfied at work are actively looking for a different job. It goes
without saying that attrition and productivity are both very real cost drivers
for your business.

Leaders have to make hard decisions all the time. What's important is that
everyone understands how the decision was made, and that their interests were
carefully considered. Communication is crucial, but your communication must lay
bare your *real concern* for employees themselves and not simply pay lip service
to how challenging the situation is.

Quite often, as leaders, we are pulled toward certain choices and outcomes by
the inexorable force of business incentive; by P&L reports, budgets, planning
meetings, dashboards, and the ambitious lieutenants who learned "exactly how to
manage this" at McKinsey or Bain.

So, what's the right move?

{{< dots >}}

As a leader, others look to you as a role model, and for explicit direction.
It's your absolute responsibility to demonstrate that the right way to build
teams and navigate difficult operational decisions is with empathy and
thoughtfulness. Putting people first, and building environments where they can
learn and thrive, will create a self-sustaining organization that automatically
attracts the skills you need to innovate, and will engender the commitment that
will make your impossible dreams possible.

When you feel that pull toward a "logical decision" whose basis is primarily
data-driven abstractions of real, human employees, do two things: first,
consider whether this choice is a real one---what alternatives might exist?
Second, be as uncomfortably transparent as possible.

As a great leader, you are ready to rise to this challenge.

## Questions for you

1. When you have to make a hard decision, how do you communicate it?

2. How satisfied are the people on your teams? How do you know that?

3. What is one thing you can do this week to show the people on your teams the
   impact their work is having on the business?
