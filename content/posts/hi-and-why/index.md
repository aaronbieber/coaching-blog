In an increasingly asynchronous and distributed workplace, it's super important
that managers learn how to leverage the strengths and avoid the pitfalls of a
text-oriented way of communicating.

Done right, asynchronous communication can *increase clarity*, *make decisions
more durable*, and even *enforce equitability* within teams. But done wrong, it
can hinder progress, create churn, and even add unnecessary stress and anxiety.

Here are a few things you can do to be sure you're *getting communication right*
in your distributed teams.<!--more-->

I love this "manager promise" from Matthew Rechs (above). This is a great rule
for everyone to live by, but managers even moreso. If your manager sends you a
single message, "Hi," and then waits for a response, how does that make you
feel?

You're left wondering what's coming next; will it be a routine question, some
critical feedback... Something worse? Who knows!

## Rule #1: no preamble

When you open a new DM with someone, no matter who it is, put the reason you're
writing and (preferably) the request you are making in the first message. That
doesn't mean it has to be one sentence, it just means that when you press
"send," the recipient has everything they need to know.

Of course it's OK to be personable and to show empathy for your recipient, to
ask how they're doing, and so on. Nonetheless, be brief, and include your reason
for writing and the request you're making *in that same message* before you send
it.

## Rule #2: async/await

Email and chat are both powerful tools, but we quite often misuse them. We
expect that when we send a message, there is a person there on the other end
eager to receive and respond to it.

But as the recipient of messages ourselves, we know that isn't the
case. Everyone has work to do and limited attention to spend on the many things
that demand it throughout the day.

Write your messages knowing, and accepting, that they may not be read for quite
some time. Here are a couple of ways to acknowledge the reality of async in your
communications:

1. Be aware of the recipient's local time. If it's early or late for them,
   explicitly note whether the message can wait until normal hours, or consider
   scheduling the send (Gmail and Slack both support scheduling).
   
2. Include *all relevant details*. To reduce "round trips," take a moment to
   ensure that all the necessary context and detail is there, so the recipient
   can absorb and consider it before responding.

3. Offer async alternatives. If you're making a trivial, non-urgent request,
   perhaps any brief response will work. But if your request is more important
   or urgent, you might offer to chat live to work through the issue. Make it
   clear what you're willing to do to get to a resolution. Bear the burden of
   that coordination.

## Rule #3: The right tool for the job

Has this ever happened to you? You receive a DM from a colleague, they have a
question about a project, and you start chatting. After a few messages, it
becomes clear that they haven't really thought things through before
writing. You're answering questions that you know they know the answers to, they
just hadn't thought of the questions yet.

This is a classic case of reaching for a DM when what was needed was probably a
document. Too many meetings should have been emails, and emails should have been
DMs, and DMs should have been documents.

Here's a quick, non-exhaustive guide for when to use which tool:

### Email

You need an answer from one or more people, and it isn't critically
time-sensitive, but it's very important that the recipient(s) do see it
eventually. Email is still the number-one best way to be sure your message isn't
overlooked, even if it's not read for a while.

### Slack

Slack's own marketing claims that it will replace email, and folks do use it for
longer-form async communication, so I won't say that's *wrong* to do, but it
isn't Slack's strongest suit.

Use Slack for quick, more time-sensitive, and less important or complex
communications. Slack is a great way to let a whole team know about something
that's happening, or to coordinate during production issues. It's not a great
way to get consensus for a wide-reaching and highly impactful change.

### A document (of some kind)

Write a document when you, yourself, aren't sure of all the details. Writing the
document itself can drive your clarity. Until you can get your point across in a
document, you probably don't know what your point is, yet.

A document is an excellent choice for *converging* on a resolution with multiple
people, if you're using an interactive document like a Google Doc, where
comments and suggested edits can be contributed by others. There is almost no
faster way I have ever seen to go from "seed of an idea" to "fully realized
plan" than with a co-edited document.

## Async forever!

In the end, *writing drives clarity*. The more we each lean into the strengths
of writing to organize our own thoughts and make concise and well-articulated
points, the less time we'll spend churning and rehashing things.

As a manager, remember that your directs *care about everything you write*. When
you DM someone, respect the power of your words. Don't just say "hi" and leave
them hanging!

If you've had a great (or bad) experience with async communication, I'd love to
hear about it.
