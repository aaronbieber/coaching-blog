I've been doing some technical interviews lately at `$DAYJOB`, and a few of
those experiences inspired me to write down some thoughts about mistakes I've
seen and what I think you can do to be a great technical candidate. My
interviews are for individual contributor roles, but a lot of this advice
applies to any technical role, whether that's a hybrid "tech lead" type of
position, engineering manager, or even a technical product manager.

In complete honesty, I'm shocked at how badly some of my interviews went. I
don't think this is because we did a poor job screening candidates, or even that
the candidates themselves were *incapable* of meeting the requirements of the
role. That said, many of these folks categorically failed to demonstrate their
abilities and were passed over as a result.

Hopefully what I share here can help you to avoid that outcome for yourself!

## Prepare!

Rule number one for any interview process is preparation. Whether we like it or
not, an interview is a performance, and there is no successful performance that
doesn't start with some amount of rehearsal.

First things first: research the company you're interviewing for. Assuming you'd
actually like to land this job, you have a responsibility to learn as much as
you can about it. During my time working at Wayfair, I interviewed so many
engineering candidates who didn't, *even once*, browse the website.

I like to ask domain-specific interview questions because I was that kid in
school who was frustrated to learn abstract concepts like trigonometry without
some notion of why they're useful. If you're coming to work on an e-commerce
website, I'm going to ask you how you'd build querystring parameters to handle
the search and filter options on a product browse page. Try to get an
understanding of the domain, and have opinions about it.

My favorite thing was when candidates had not only browsed the website, but had
strong feelings about things we could do better, or ideas we could try. Even if
they were stupid ideas, it showed that they gave it some thought and could
imagine themselves in the driver's seat, contributing to the product.

If the product is not a public website, or if the domain is a classically
secretive one (like government contracting, defense, etc.), find out what you
can. Don't be afraid to ask specific probing questions when you speak with
recruiters at the company. They might be your only reliable source of inside
information!

Second, but no less important: if you're going out for an individual contributor
role in software, *be able to write software*. It's OK if you've been in
management for a while, or taking a break from work entirely. Life comes at us
pretty fast and we have to roll with it, but when you're being asked to do a
straightforward programming exercise you'd better be able to do some
programming.

The thing is, I just can't trust that everything on your resume is true. A
resume is like a very blurry picture that begins to form some rough shapes, but
resumes are notoriously easy to falsify and challenging to verify, so the only
real evidence I have for your current skills is what you can do in the
interview.

And look, I know that this sucks, and I know that our industry's classic
approach to interviewing is imperfect and that it's more of an art than a
science to separate the signal from the noise, but if you show up to a technical
round and can't cobble together a couple of functions in Javascript or Python or
*something*, my faith in you is rapidly plummeting.

I don't do "leetcode" interviews. Not as the interviewer nor as the candidate.
If you can write a depth-first binary tree search from scratch all it really
tells me is that you can memorize things. Still, spending a little time leading
up to an interview "sharpening your tools" by running through some exercises
online is not a bad idea, and it can only help you.

Get comfortable being asked a hard question and just breaking it down, writing
out the questions you would ask an interviewer to steer your solution, and
hashing out the structure of the code. To me, that's 90% of the job anyway. Can
you collaborate, bring value through ideas, and translate your concepts into
working code? How do you demonstrate that?

## Set the tone

As I said before, whether you like it or not, an interview is a performance.
During your interview, you need to bring out the most confident version of
yourself that you know. For that bounded window of time in which you're showing
off what you can do, you need to *believe* that you can do the job.

If you made it into a live-coding round, you must have done something right!
This is not the time to dig on yourself or make excuses for any of your
perceived skill gaps. Nobody wants to work with someone who is constantly hating
on themselves and jumping under every bus that drives by.

If you want to tell me that you're really anxious and that it takes you time to
get comfortable working on a problem, that's fine! It can be hard to admit that
to a stranger, and I applaud your honesty. But leave it at that.

If you're going to fail, if you have the sudden realization that you're way
beyond your depth, make it your mission to flame out spectacularly! Dig in, try
hard, focus on asking great questions, and get as far as you can with what you
know. 

I've hired countless engineers who could not complete the entire coding
exercise because I know that smart, motivated people can use Google. What you
need to demonstrate is that you can see where your gaps are and that you have
some idea of how to fill them. Ask direct questions ("can I assume X?"), lean on
your resources ("is it okay if I look this up real quick?"), and be clear about
what you do and do not know ("I think a regular expression would be perfect
here, but I don't remember the syntax").

Self-awareness is a surprisingly rare and powerful attribute. Show that you know
what you know, but frame it as a strength, because it is. Instead of "I'm so
rusty, I'm sorry I can't write this simple loop," spin it around into something
like "I haven't written Javascript in a while but I know there is a syntax for
this, is it okay if I look that up?"
