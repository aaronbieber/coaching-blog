Maybe you heard about Roy Lee? He's a 21-year-old CS student at Columbia (well,
for now) who developed an "undetectable" program that observes problems
presented in your remote interview meeting and solves them on an overlay that
only you can see. "Interview Coder" eats leetcode for breakfast.

Roy used his tool in real interviews for positions at Meta, TikTok, and Amazon,
and received offers. As soon as he came clean and started selling the tool, the
offers were rescinded, though Roy told journalists that senior folks from large
companies contacted him directly offering him jobs, no questions asked.

Let's be clear: hiding a tool that's doing all the work for you and pretending
that you did it is cheating. Secretly using your calculator watch to remember
the decimal for 1/8th of an inch (it's 0.125 by the way) is also cheating. I
thought I was pretty clever when I did it, though.

But Roy has been outspoken in interviews that he believes that leetcode problems
are pointless. It would be like judging someone's ability in journalism by how
many jumping jacks they can do, he said on the Hard Fork podcast. I think he's
right, and with this explosion of AI tools, he's more right than ever.

The "intent" of leetcode is that candidates have internalized all of these
algorithmic approaches and can dance through really challenging and arcane
problems as a result. What is actually happening is that CS students are
spending hundreds of hours on the leetcode site, memorizing the solutions to the
problems in the hope that one will be asked verbatim (which they usually are).

To my mind, this is like hiring whoever can remember the most digits of pi. The
problem they're trying to solve is that they have too many candidates and since
they already filtered down to the ones with the most prestigious degrees or most
relevant experience, the last hurdle is "have you done hundreds of hours of
unpaid labor to try to work here?"

And now, in this age of ubiquitous, massive LLMs, we can see more clearly than
ever that the king is not wearing any clothes.

The way software interviews are carried out has always been just a little bit
bonkers. I mean, really, writing code on a whiteboard is as representative of
real programming ability as building a model airplane is of your ability to
build a *real* airplane. We wouldn't ask a carpenter to demonstrate their
ability to do the job without half of their actual tools, would we? Yet we do,
all the time!

These leetcode problems themselves are so far from what most programmers
encounter in their entire careers, and then we expect candidates to solve them
in a weird little web IDE with shitty autocomplete.

I agree with Roy Lee, leetcode is cooked.
