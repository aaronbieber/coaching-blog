I've been thinking a lot about loyalty lately. I promise this is not a thinly
veiled pitch for any product or service, this is a real story.

My grandfather wrote at least a few lines in a journal every day for like forty
years. My dad has a box of these little annual journal books and the only gap
was when my dad was born. He'd write down what the weather was like, what
happened that day, maybe how he felt about it.

Through those journals, we can trace his professional life. When he was old
enough to work, he got a job operating an elevator for a company called Fafnir
Bearing, which designed and manufactured ball bearings. Those were the days when
elevators had operators.

By World War II, Fafnir Bearing was pumping out 100 bearings per minute from
their 600,000 square foot factory in New Britain, Connecticut. They were the
biggest independent bearing manufacturer in the United States. They manufactured
parts that went to the moon on Apollo 11.

Over those years, my grandfather moved from the elevator to the factory floor.
From the factory floor to the design department. When Japanese fighter planes
were recovered by the US military during the war, my grandfather was among the
folks who helped analyze their technology. He learned "on the job."

He ended his career as a master draftsman at Fafnir Bearing. After his death,
his widow—my grandmother—had cataract surgery and it was paid for by the Fafnir
Bearing insurance trust. Her healthcare was taken care of for the rest of her
life.

Today's companies grow so fast. Hire and fire so fast. Reid Hoffman even wrote a
book about it called "Blitzscaling." (A profoundly gross book.) Grow so fast
that you own the market before the realities of your lopsided business model
catch up to you because by then it won't matter! You'll be able to fuck everyone
equally, just like Amazon! Suppliers? Fuck them! Customers? Fuck them, too!

Employees? Well, you get the picture. Cory Doctorow calls it "enshittification."

Imagine what business could be like if we actually cared. About people. About
their future. About *our* future *together*. Companies don't exist without
people, as hard as Sam Altman may try to change that.

Who is your "elevator operator?" What would it take for them to become a "master
draftsman?" That's what loyalty looks like. What it used to look like, right
here, in this country, when we put our people first.
