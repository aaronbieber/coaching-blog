I've been thinking a lot about loyalty lately.

My grandfather wrote at least a few lines in a journal every day for something
like forty years. My dad has a box of these little annual journal books and the
only gap was when my dad was born. He'd write down what the weather was like,
what happened that day, maybe how he felt about it.

Through those journals, we can trace his professional life.

When he was old enough to work, he got a job operating an elevator for a company
called Fafnir Bearing, which designed and manufactured ball bearings. Those were
the days when elevators had operators.

By World War II, Fafnir Bearing was pumping out 100 bearings per minute from
their 600,000 square foot factory in New Britain, Connecticut. They were the
biggest independent bearing manufacturer in the United States. They manufactured
parts that went to the moon on Apollo 11.

Over those years, my grandfather moved from the elevator to the factory floor.
From the factory floor to the design department. When Japanese fighter planes
were recovered by the US military during the war, my grandfather was among the
folks who helped analyze their technology. He learned everything he knew "on the
job."

He ended his career as a master draftsman at Fafnir Bearing. He had worked there
for his entire life. After his death, his widow---my grandmother---had cataract
surgery and it was paid for by the Fafnir Bearing insurance trust. Her
healthcare was taken care of for the rest of her life.

Today's companies grow so fast. They hire and fire so fast. Reid Hoffman (the
co-founder of LinkedIn, among other things) even wrote a book about it called
"Blitzscaling" (a profoundly gross book, by the way). A generous synopsis of the
book is, "grow so fast that you have built a competitive moat before anyone else
can catch up to you."

A more realistic one is, "own the market before the realities of your lopsided
business model catch up to you because by then it won't matter!" You're a
monopoly, you're a [*monopsony*][m]; you're the immovable object *and* the
unstoppable force! You'll be able to fuck everyone equally, just like Amazon
does! Suppliers? Fuck them! Customers? Fuck them, too!

Employees? Well, you get the picture. Cory Doctorow calls it "enshittification."

Imagine what business could be like if we actually cared. About people. About
their future. About *our* future *together*. Companies don't exist without
people, as hard as Sam Altman may try to change that.

Wait, no, don't imagine, I'll tell you about one. I'm sure you know of Costco,
the membership-only warehouse club store. I'm confident you've heard of them
because they're the *third largest retailer in the world* by revenue (right
after WalMart and Amazon), so what I'm about to share isn't a function of not
making a ton of money or anything.

Costco reportedly has a 90% retention rate across all employees who stay on
beyond their first year. Loyalty is a two-way street and Costco has figured out
how to pave it. They have built a strong corporate culture around hiring from
within; many of their senior executives started their Costco careers in a
warehouse.

Meanwhile, internal Amazon documents were leaked to Engadget in 2022 that showed
that the company had a *150% annual turnover rate*, which Forbes claimed is
double the "industry average." Why do people want to stay at Costco, and why do
people want to leave Amazon?

The answer to that question is the foundation of loyalty. If you are loyal to
your employees, they feel safer investing themselves in you. If you run your
business like a human woodchipper, you take what you can get.

In 2023, Amazon stopped testing job applicants for cannabis use. Now, I don't
care if you smoke weed, and neither should Amazon, but the story they told us
was that "eliminating pre-employment testing for cannabis allows us to expand
our applicant pool." Let me translate that for you: *we have to backfill a ton
of roles and we're running out of people who haven't smoked weed lately.*

Think about that for a hot second. Amazon had to loosen their long-held drug use
policy specifically because they were failing to get enough people to run
through their little gauntlet.

On July 1, 1978, the New York Times prepared their newspaper for print. The
process was carried out in the same way that it had been, in the same composing
room, for the last *127 years*. But that night was different.

It was the last time that the New York Times would use "hot type," a method by
which letterforms are cast line-by-line into molten lead and set into columns
and pages by hand. From the following day forward, the Times was typeset on
computers and the press plates were produced using a "cold type" process.

Those 127 years of Times history were made possible by the [Mergenthaler
Linotype machine][lt], a fantastically complicated but remarkably reliable hot
type "line casting" machine invented by German clock maker Ottmar Mergenthaler
and first deployed in 1886 at the New York Tribune.

One quirk of the Linotype machine is its entirely alien keyboard, arranged in
sections by case, number, and in order by English letter frequency. To the best
of my knowledge, that keyboard layout was never used before, and would never be
used again by any other machine.

The Times meticulously planned the transition from "hot type" to "cold type."
They had to buy, install, and configure banks of computer terminals, huge
reel-to-reel tape storage machines, and so forth. They had to run both Linotype
machines and computers in parallel to be sure it would all work. There are print
deadlines to keep!

In the fantastic documentary [Farewell, Etaoin Shurdlu][fes], you will meet some
of the typsetters who spent decades hammering on the keys of Linotype machines.
There is a certain romanticism around it. You will also learn that the Times
re-trained any typesetter willing to stay in how to use the "cold type" methods.

This loyalty of the Times to its typesetters was surely both a cultural waypoint
in American labor history, and also a direct result of the incredibly strong
International Typographical Union (ITU), whose "New York Local #6" chapter was
referred to in composing rooms as "Big Six."

At the turn of the century, unions like the ITU were responsible for structural
changes in work conditions that we all blindly take for granted. Thanks to
organized strikes in most major cities in 1906, the
ITU [won an eight-hour work day][eight] for its typesetters (down from the
ten-hour standard at the time).

Still, unions notwithstanding, we have choices about where we invest our
energies. As employers, are we willing to invest in education, on-the-job
training, and are we able to take a long view of an employee's value to the
business?

As employees, are we prepared for the possibility that any employer can, without
provocation, instantly end our employment? Are we taking advantage of every
benefit the company is offering so that we are ready for the day that some
fundamental technology or process shift occurs?

In our "work at will" atmosphere here in the United States, I'm afraid there are
no guarantees. But if we play our cards right, maybe we can make the most of it.

For the leaders out there, here is my question for you:

Who is your "elevator operator?" What would it take for them to become a "master
draftsman?" That's what loyalty looks like. What it used to look like, right
here, in this country, when we put our people first.
