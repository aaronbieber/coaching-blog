To make a real impact in your work, and on the world, you need more than one
type of person. That sounds obvious, given our understanding of the importance
of diversity, but we need more than differing *perspectives*, we also need
differing *personalities*, and there is a simple way to think about it that
can help you *build* a successful environment around you.

The moment I began to understand how I fit into these three simple types, it
gave me an entirely new perspective on my work.<!--more-->

[Shreyas Doshi][shreyas], a product management leader who cut his teeth at Yahoo!, Google,
and Twitter, describes three types of product leaders (though I believe that
this applies much more broadly):

1. The operator
2. The craftsperson
3. The visionary

In his words, **operators** are "excellent at scaling teams, cross-org alignment,
unblocking execution." They're great at communication. They're not great at
original insights.

**Craftspeople** are excellent at "defining products and strategy, mentoring
[others]." They're not great at original insights, and they struggle with large
orgs and the associated burdens.

**Visionaries** are excellent at "big-picture thinking, inventing what's next."
They see what others can't. They fall short on people issues and scaling without
help.

Think about your team. Are you working with people like these? Which one are
you? Which parts feel like they fit just right, and which parts are less
accurate, for you? Are you a mix of more than one? In what ratio?

The fact is, you need all three of these. Without infusion of vision, you'll
race toward the middle. Without craftspeople, you'll accumulate product and
technical debt until you can't move forward. And without operators, you'll fail
to execute, especially as the organization and product grows larger and more complex.

## My realization

What I came to realize is that I'm the visionary, full stop. My strengths are in
observing, perceiving patterns, intuiting solutions, and thinking "big"
thoughts. My mind is automatically attracted to concepts and possibilities. I
have to exert real energy to think in terms of small details.

Knowing this, I can consider two things:

1. How can I shape my work so that I spend most of my time doing the things I'm
   naturally good at?
2. How can I surround myself with the other types of people, so that we can win
   together?

These are obviously very personal questions, and I don't have all the
answers. In my coaching practice, I'm very often able to tap into my listening
and pattern-matching skills, and I hired a coach because I need someone to be my
"operator" and hold me accountable on tactics. Those are two ways that knowing
this has helped me create a successful environment for myself.

Think about these questions for yourself. Where can you lean into your
*innate superpowers*? How can you empower others to fill your natural gaps?
