Everyone is required to write almost continuously at work, and writing remains
the single best solution to the many communication and collaboration challenges
that face our fast-moving, distributed teams. Yet writing skill in the workplace
is greatly varied in my experience, and few companies make a deliberate
investment in improving the writing ability of their workforce.

Can you think of any other skill that is required, crucial, has a wide breadth
of mastery with a direct impact on the operations of a business, and which
*nobody is ever trained to do*?

The work-from-anywhere revolution is already here, and the software industry is
its vanguard. Back in 2012 I worked at a start-up with a guy who was literally
"couch surfing" around the world as a full-time software contractor for us. The
COVID-19 pandemic only accelerated this shift. Companies were forced to
experiment to survive, and the smart ones have adapted and emerged stronger for
it.

Back in the '80s, remote sales people would travel the country hunting for
payphones so they could check in with the home office for messages or new
orders. Today, we're all connected all the time (for better or worse). That
connection is accomplished, by and large, through writing. We pour thousands of
words into emails, wikis, live chats, ticketing systems, commit messages,
collaborative documents, and more every single day.

No matter what your role or function, writing is undoubtedly central to how you
plan, collaborate, and execute your work. It may seem obvious, but writing is
the best tool for this job because it transcends space and time. You can write
something that is read instantly by someone thousands of miles away, or you can
write something that is read many years later, by *you*.

Notwithstanding the challenges of full-text search (a topic I am deliberately
avoiding here), written words are trivial to record and can be later recovered
for some as yet unforeseen reason. No other form of communication shares this
property. Even as I write this, our ability to find and recover previously
written text is improving.

When you need a piece of information to be received now, but also later, by
people who are nearby, but also far away, there is no substitute for writing.

In spite of the ubiquity and necessity of writing, few do it very well. Writing
accomplishes its essential purpose when executed with modest aptitude, and that
"essential purpose" is typically the bar to hit. We all know how to string words
together, and everyone mostly makes sense when they do it.

But much more is possible for someone able to ply the craft of writing with
mastery. As a tool for persuasion, engagement, and tight alignment, your writing
needs to do more than just "make sense."

Moreover, writing well does more than just engage, align, and persuade. The
practice of writing is the method of clear thinking, a fact that is famously
exploited at Amazon by their practice of writing so-called "six-pagers." Few
unclear and unsupported thoughts survive their encounter with the page.

As your unfiltered brain-slop passes through the sieve of writing, only the
relevant bits survive to be arranged in some pleasing and sense-making manner.
Writing *well* only means that fewer bits of slop make it through the sieve, and
their arrangement is all the more striking.

Of course that description makes it sound easier than it is; it may be simple
and yet still be very hard. I'm reminded of this humorous fictional account of
the events surrounding Michelangelo's unveiling of the statue of David, in which
Michelangelo is asked how he could have created such a masterpiece from a "crude
slab of marble."

Michelangelo answers, "All I did was chip away everything that didn't look like David."

While silly and perhaps reductive, it's not bad advice. Maybe the first thing to
do is know what it is you're trying to create and what it might look like. The
rest is just practice.

## Questions for you
  
1. How could better writing help to solve a problem that your team faces right
   now?

2. What would it mean if everyone on your team could send any idea through time
   and space with no loss of fidelity?

3. What is one investment you can make in your own writing, and what do you want
   to happen as a result?
