"Impostor syndrome" is a belief that you don't deserve the success or luck that
you enjoy. In the tech world, it is often a sense that you aren't "living up to"
the title you hold, or team you lead, or something like that.

Impostor syndrome *can* be quite crippling, because it robs you of the
confidence to take risks, make mistakes, and grow as a person and an employee.

These are some of the tricks that I've discovered for overcoming impostor
syndrome and freeing yourself to grow, learn, and create.


## Recognize your inner impostor

Impostor syndrome is called a syndrome because it's a "collection of symptoms."
These are things that you, the impostor syndrome sufferer, feel. The first step
to overcoming impostor syndrome is understanding that it is inside of you, it is
internal to you.

As with most internal struggles, the next step in managing it is recognizing
it. If you can come to recognize when your inner impostor is speaking, telling
you that you don't "deserve" what you've achieved or that your success in a task
is uncertain, you can reframe it.

In a 1978 paper on the subject by researchers Clance and Imes, participants were
prompted to simply change thoughts like "I might fail this exam" to "I will do
well on this exam." Simply rephrasing it to yourself before the event improved
imposter feelings in participants.

It may also help to review positive feedback or other objective data and lean
into the *cognitive dissonance* of observing your success and feeling like an
impostor at the same time.

## Let it out

Another way to grapple with internal struggles is to externalize them. This is
where a mentor, peer group, or another social support system can be very
helpful. Consider sharing your impostor feelings with people you trust and hear
their feedback and their personal experiences.

Even simply knowing that others have the same feelings that you do can go a long
way to rob those feelings of their negative power over you.

A coach could also help you observe what is happening, reframe it in a
productive way, and take the next step forward toward your goals. Sometimes that
calibrated external signal makes all the difference.

## Don't "fake it till you make it"

This all-too-common advice is more likely to make your feelings worse than
better. First, if you convince yourself that you're "faking it," you will fail
to recognize your successes as valid. Second, projecting inauthentic confidence
is going to create a bigger internal tension that can feed into your spiral of
self-doubt.

Instead of "faking it," realize that *everyone is faking it*. We're all doing
the best we can with what we know and the opportunities available to us, and
guess what? That's not fake, that's how the world works.

## Well done!

With these few tips in-hand, you should be able to take the first step toward
vanquishing your impostor syndrome!

So, how is it going? Please let me know how you're doing managing *your*
impostor syndrome, I'd really like to hear about it.
