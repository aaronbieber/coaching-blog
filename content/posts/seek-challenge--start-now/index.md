The only reliable way to achieve anything substantial is through consistent,
sustained action. Moreover, any truly *substantial* accomplishments take a long
time, on the order of years.

In this, there are two key hurdles to overcome:

1. If you want to achieve something substantial, start now, and don't
   stop. Doing something, no matter how small, is infinitely better than doing
   nothing.

2. The penalty for avoiding sustained and consistent progress, especially in
   technology, is obsolescence.

If you want to achieve more than you've ever dreamed, *you can*. The main reason
you think you can't is because it's going to take years, and you can't see all
of the steps from where you are right now, so to you it appears to be
impossible.

Let's break it down.<!--more-->

So the first lesson is "shortcuts don't exist." The only way *out* is *through*,
and consistent, sustained efforts (no matter how small) will always win out in
the end.

That's great advice coming from a guy who wrote a book all about habits! One of
the key methods of achieving consistent, sustained effort is by building habits.

This might sound a little like the kind of thing you'd find in a self-help book
with a stylized picture of a sunrise on the cover or something, but this applies
to your technical career, too.

That was true in 1999, but it's even more true today. Staying up-to-date with
the latest trends, let alone achieving proficiency in each new technology,
absolutely requires a sustained effort. Anyone who allows their skills to
plateau for a few years may find themselves left behind.

I know I felt that way after doing straight management for a few years and then
returning to a more hands-on role, and I've heard that same story many times
before.

## Recipe for sustained progress

As we've talked about, the most important thing is *consistency*. Making
regular, disciplined progress, no matter how small, is the key.

### Build a habit

No matter what your goal, find a way to make some contribution toward it
*habitually*. It doesn't have to be daily---it could be *every Tuesday* or *at
least twice a month*---set a schedule that works for you, but stick to it.

For advice on the mechanics of creating successful habits, read [Atomic
Habits][atomic] by James Clear, or [The Power of Habit][power] by Charles
Duhigg.

### Smallest biggest

When you sit down to make that contribution toward your goal, I love this idea
from executive coach Robert Ellis: choose the *biggest smallest* thing to work
on. Biggest meaning that it matters, it will move you toward your goal. Smallest
means that success is assured, you cannot fail at it.

Stack enough of those things together, day after day, week after week, and
pretty soon you're going to be creating significant impact.
