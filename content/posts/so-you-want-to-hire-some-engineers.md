It should go without saying that one of the most important---and most
challenging---responsibilities of an engineering manager is hiring.

In a recent survey of 581 tech founders and executives[^1]:

[^1]: [What Tech Leaders Really Think About Remote Work, the Downturn, and the Great Resignation](https://www.a.team/mission/2022-tech-work-report?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

* 62% say it takes 4 months or more to hire top product and engineering talent
  *on average*.
  
* 67% agree that the "traditional recruitment process" is broken, taking too
  long and costing too much.
  
At the same time, tech workers are more restless than ever before, changing jobs
at a staggering rate.

What should you do if you want to succeed in hiring the engineers you need for
your team today? As we say in most engineering matters, "it depends," but these
are my *earnestly held beliefs* about what matters most:

 1. Attract (enough of) the right people,
 2. Conduct an exceptional interview
 3. Sell what's important
 
This is going to be a long one because there is a lot to say and it's all important.

## Attract (enough of) the right people

Aside from referrals, which you should also use, your primary vehicle for
attracting people to your roles is your job descriptions.

Two key elements that have an outsized impact on who may apply to your role are
*word choice* and *hard qualifications*.

### Choose your words wisely

As you may be aware, among the most qualified applicants for your roles there
are women, but chances are you'll never meet them because your job descriptions
drive them away.

If you want women to apply for your open roles, avoid using any of these
masculine-oriented words (and if you're still writing "rock star" or "ninja" in
2022, you don't deserve to hire anyone anyway)[^2]:

 * Active 
 * Adventurous 
 * Aggressive 
 * Ambitious/ambition
 * Analytical
 * Assertive
 * Autonomous
 * Decisive
 * Determined 
 * Dominant/dominating
 * Independent
 * Lead
 * Ninja
 * Objective
 * Outspoken
 * Rock star
 * Superior
 
Instead, consider working in some of these more inclusive terms:

 * Adaptable
 * Collaborate
 * Creative
 * Curious
 * Multitasking
 * Imaginative
 * Intuitive
 * Resilient
 * Self-aware
 * Thoughtful
 * Trustworthy

Personally, I would much rather work with a team of *adaptable, self-aware,
curious, trustworthy* folks than a bunch of *aggressive, superior, dominating
rock stars*, but that's just me.

### Require only what's required

Scrutinize "hard requirements" on job postings, especially degrees.

Stated requirements turn away applicants, so be sure that every stated
requirement is a "hard" requirement. While it appears to be true that hard
requirements turn away more women than men[^3], the difference isn't as large as you
may have been led to believe.

In the end, turning away any applicant because they fail to clear a bar that
you and your team would consider "negotiable" only strangles your candidate
funnel.

{{< dots >}}

Consider whether your role has a degree requirement *at all*. When candidates
greatly outnumber roles, setting a degree requirement is a convenient filter to
reduce recruiting burden. But today, with roles historically difficult to fill,
you may be artificially limiting your options.

Moreover, some of the most talented folks I've worked with have not had computer
science degrees. Many of them had other four-year degrees, such as music,
digital media, or a different engineering discipline like mechanical or
biomedical engineering.

In fact, I've found that even graduate degrees don't guarantee the kind of
adaptability, critical thinking skills, or resourcefulness that I personally
value on my software teams. I am not claiming an inverse correlation, but I
suggest that the strength of the correlation may not be what you think it is.
 
## Conduct an exceptional interview

The interview process itself is crucial, not only to determining a candidate's
fitness for a role, but also to *sell* the candidate on the opportunity the role
presents for them. I have only one rule about interviews and this is it:

> **Aaron's Law of Interviewing**: An interview that doesn't resemble the job is
> not an interview at all.

Interviews ought to be *practical* and *collaborative*, because that's what
the role you're trying to fill is going to be like.

### Quit it with the binary trees, already

All those clever questions you ask to "pressure test" candidates on solving the
gnarliest problems you proudly contrived for the purpose? They are less than
worthless if the actual job is copying and pasting code from StackOverflow.

If the role is truly to optimize compilers or build distributed database systems
or whatever, by all means, evaluate that. But don't you dare ask a candidate to
write a depth-first binary tree search unless they have a substantial chance of
encountering that problem in the course of the job.

Every programming job I've ever had was 75% searching the internet and 25%
understanding how not to shoot myself in the foot. You're better off evaluating
the candidate's ability to understand whether a StackOverflow solution *is
actually good* than asking them to synthesize some arcane algorithm on a
whiteboard.

The best interviews I've been in included things like pair programming
activities, code comprehension, and collaborative system design. The less it
feels like taking the SAT, the more realistic a read you're going to get on what
it's like to *actually work with* this person.

### Sell the important stuff

This piece in Gallup[^4] from mid-2021 puts it succinctly:

> The great resignation is really the great discontent.

[^4]: [The 'Great Resignation' Is Really the 'Great Discontent'](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/351545/great-resignation-really-great-discontent.aspx)

Workers are changing jobs *mainly* because they're not engaged. The Gallup
analysis, which was conducted across all industries, "identified a[n] 
employee engagement rate of [...] 34% in the U.S. and Canada."

In other words, 66% of American workers are disengaged in their jobs.

The likelihood is high that every candidate you're talking to is considering
your role as a replacement for a role they currently have, that they just don't
love. If you can get an understanding of what is falling short for them, you can
determine whether your role will be a fit.

No matter the individual's specific circumstances, there are two things that
every employee wants, and that you should sell as hard as you can:

 1. Purpose
 2. Flexibility
 
{{< dots >}}

More than ever, tech workers are realizing that they have the choice and ability
to spend their time contributing to something *that matters*, and they want a
job that gives them some *sense of purpose*[^5].

For some, the company's mission is important---they may want to contribute to a
social or environmental cause. For others, simply being a part of something that
the company itself holds as crucial to success is enough.

The desire for "higher stakes" and leadership buy-in is repeated often in the
conversations I have with my coaching clients. If you can't demonstrate how the
role you're filling and the work the team is doing *really matters*, you may
fail to close these candidates.

You may also want to quit that job, too.

{{< dots >}}

Finally, flexibility in where and when and how to work are more important to
tech workers than ever before. Whether your company is mostly in-office, fully
hybrid, or fully remote, you need to understand where your flexibility level
sits relative to your competitors.

> When open to working remotely, software engineers on the Hired platform
> received 20% more interview requests overall than candidates who are not.[^6]

[^6]: [Hired 2022 State of Software Engineers](https://hired.com/2022-state-of-software-engineers/)

The fact is this: an increasing number of companies, with fat wallets, are open
to hiring the talent they need *wherever they may be*. If you also need to hire
that talent, you'd better come to the table with a compelling story about what
flexibility you can offer.

No matter what your company's policies are, you, as a manager, are responsible
for creating the *environment for success* for your teams. That means ensuring
that on-site and remote employees have equal access to information, equal
ability to share their opinions and solutions, and that everyone feels like a
member of the same team.

An interview is your chance to proudly explain all you've done to level that
playing field.

## Questions for you

 1. Are you talking to the candidates you want to be talking to? If not, what is
    turning them away?
    
 2. If you took your own interview, would *you* want the job?
 
 3. What meaningful contribution will your new team member be able to make *in
    the first six months*? Do candidates for the role know this?
