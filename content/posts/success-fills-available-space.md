There are some separate themes here:

* Don't manage the "how," manage the "why." Very Simon Sinek, very Art of
  Action. As a leader, especially a senior leader several levels removed from
  the people doing the "real work," you serve the organization best by focusing
  on the intent, the desired outcome.
  
* Focusing on "why" and "intent" are tactical implementations for the goal of
  providing space and trust to teams. Fire people when they're not understanding
  the outcome, when they're defying the desired outcome. Don't expect them to do
  exactly what you would do.

"If you could imagine it, you wouldn't need a team to do it."

Teams build things you couldn't build on your own. By definition, a team builds
something they invented. It serves a purpose that you've defined, but if you
could imagine all the details of what it needed to be, why did you hire a team?

I can already think of some leaders saying "I know how it should be, I just
can't do it fast enough by myself." Maybe that's a bad reason to be in
leadership? If you just need speed, or parallelism, bring in contractors.


But what's the thesis?




 * Leadership is about being a *conduit* for customer and business need

 * Team needs are secondary to customer needs, but still more important than
   your personal needs

 * Of course this is contrary to all of our evolutionary instincts and our sense
   of ego (?)

 * The limits of success for your team, beyond obvious skill and resources
   constraints, are at the edges of your own ego

 * If you want your team to succeed, you need to get out of their way

 * Chasing promotions, profits, etc., is the opposite of truly chasing success.
   Success is a lagging proxy metric so it's hard to pin down (?)


What could we learn from the failures of the Boeing 737 MAX and the Sears retail
chain? What leadership mistakes were made?

Success expands to fill the available space. One way to be certain your team
will have little to no success is by filling all the available space with your
ego.

What does the defunct retail chain *Sears, Roebuck and Company* have in common
with the *Boeing 737 MAX*? Both catastrophically failed because leaders let
their egos suffocate their teams.

Sometimes the key to success---or to avoiding failure---is to do the thing that
many leaders are afraid to: *let go*.

TODO maybe something here from Art of Action about the propensity of leadership
to implement more measures and controls. I can quote the book.
