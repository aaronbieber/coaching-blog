What could we learn from the failures of the Boeing 737 MAX and the Sears retail
chain? What leadership mistakes were made?

Success expands to fill the available space. One way to be certain your team
will have little to no success is by filling all the available space with your
ego.

What does the defunct retail chain *Sears, Roebuck and Company* have in common
with the *Boeing 737 MAX*? Both catastrophically failed because leaders let
their egos suffocate their teams.

Sometimes the key to success---or to avoiding failure---is to do the thing that
many leaders are afraid to: *let go*.

TODO maybe something here from Art of Action about the propensity of leadership
to implement more measures and controls. I can quote the book.
