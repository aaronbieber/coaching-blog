 * Leadership is about being a *conduit* for customer and business need

 * Team needs are secondary to customer needs, but still more important than
   your personal needs

 * Of course this is contrary to all of our evolutionary instincts and our sense
   of ego (?)

 * The limits of success for your team, beyond obvious skill and resources
   constraints, are at the edges of your own ego

 * If you want your team to succeed, you need to get out of their way

 * Chasing promotions, profits, etc., is the opposite of truly chasing success.
   Success is a lagging proxy metric so it's hard to pin down (?)


What could we learn from the failures of the Boeing 737 MAX and the Sears retail
chain? What leadership mistakes were made?

Success expands to fill the available space. One way to be certain your team
will have little to no success is by filling all the available space with your
ego.

What does the defunct retail chain *Sears, Roebuck and Company* have in common
with the *Boeing 737 MAX*? Both catastrophically failed because leaders let
their egos suffocate their teams.

Sometimes the key to success---or to avoiding failure---is to do the thing that
many leaders are afraid to: *let go*.

TODO maybe something here from Art of Action about the propensity of leadership
to implement more measures and controls. I can quote the book.
