What if the only thing standing between you and the growth, joy, and success you
desire is... *You*?

Everyone has inner parts of themselves that sabotage, distract, and create
self-doubt. I'm not sure who originally coined this, but these parts of us are
often termed "saboteurs" or "inner critics."

Once you learn what yours are, and what they look or sound like, you'll start to
recognize when you're standing in the way of achieving your own desired goals.

I'm an avoider. I don't like conflict or
[awkwardness](https://critter.blog/2020/11/19/avoid-avoiding/), and when faced
with a choice between doing the hard thing that needs doing and simply *not* doing
it, pretty often I choose not doing it.

Avoidance for the sake of comfort or situational stability is one of my
saboteurs. My saboteur is part of me, so it has access to all of my experience
and intelligence to come up with rational and plausible reasons for avoiding
what I need to do. It can be quite persuasive.

When I need to give someone hard and direct feedback, my avoidance saboteur
might convince me that the individual had a not-so-great week and doesn't need
another bit of bad news, or that really the issue at hand isn't that important
compared to other, bigger problems in the team.

In reality, we know that direct and timely feedback is [key to career
development](https://aaronbieber.coach/charter), and that withholding it for the
sake of comfort does more harm than good in the long run.

Knowing that this little voice is a trying to sabotage my goal of being the best
manager I can be, and providing the best support I can for my team, I can think
about the decision from a different angle. What is more important here, comfort
in this moment, or sustained growth for this person, whose success I'm deeply
invested in?

When you think about it that way, it's not even a choice at all!

## Vanquish your saboteurs

There are two sure-fire ways to conquer your saboteurs. One, of course, is to
[get a coach](https://aaronbieber.coach/get-started). Coaches are trained to
recognize when your saboteurs are talking through you, when you say things that
reveal your *limiting beliefs* about yourself. A coach can help you see past
that, consider a different perspective on the risk, and take the action you need
to take.

The second is to learn to recognize your saboteurs on your own. This is a bit
harder because you have to *remember to look* in the first place, but there are
some tools available to help you.

I really like this quick assessment from Positive Intelligence, [Discover Your
Saboteurs](https://assessment.positiveintelligence.com/saboteur/overview). After
answering these questions (there are 50, it takes maybe 10 minutes), you will
receive a report outlining the relative strength of each of the several Positive
Intelligence saboteurs.

As you can see, I'm a big time avoider:

You'll get access to a more in-depth report that describes each saboteur in
detail, which will help you to identify it when it's rearing its head.

Note that your saboteurs don't always *speak*. Sometimes your saboteur is just a
pattern of behavior that pulls you away from the action or point of view that
you need in that moment. Learning to recognize how your saboteurs show up for
you will help you make better decisions for yourself.

How about you? Have you discovered your saboteurs? If you have, I'd love to hear
about it!
