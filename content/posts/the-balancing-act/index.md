* Leaders must become comfortable living in a paradoxical place

* On the one hand, great leaders are honest and transparent about the sometimes
  difficult reality of the world

* On the other hand, great leaders also believe in their team and have enduring
  hope for future success

* It's easy to look around and say "this is all shit, and it's always going to
  be shit"

* It's equally easy to feel the compulsion to hide, ignore, or downplay
  challenges in a way that shows faith in the team's abilities ("this isn't a
  problem for *us*")

* The greatest leaders demonstrate realism about the present, but also faith in
  the future ("this sucks, but we have a plan and we can overcome it")

* Bad leaders place blame ("this all sucks because we failed," or worse,
  "because you failed")

* Bad leaders are apathetic at best or despondent at worst about future outcomes
  ("this is a fool's errand and I'm already looking for new jobs")

* Surviving in this liminal space between the difficulties of today and the
  hopes of tomorrow is draining, isolating, and sometimes tactically challenging.
