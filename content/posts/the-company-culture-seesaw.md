The power of an organization's culture to align, inspire, and motivate its
people is hard to overstate. If a company's culture is the sum of its values and
its behavior patterns, the culture of a company is nothing less than its *recipe
for success*.

As a founder or leader, how can you build or shape the culture of your company
or team to mix up that *perfect recipe* that leads to the success you and your
customers desire?

The first ingredient to consider is the organization's *values*. When values are
set thoughtfully, they are one of the biggest levers you can pull to build
desirable behaviors, from which your organization's culture will emerge.

The second ingredient is hiring and attrition. The fastest way to change your
organization's culture (whether you want to or not) is by hiring. What I see
quite often is that an organization pays lip service to "culture fit" elements
in their interview process, and yet hires at a high rate of speed and the
company culture suffers as a result.

Let's look at these two key ingredients one at a time, and examine how *you* can
use them to set up your organization for lasting success.

## Values

In the context of an organization, values are things the company holds in high
regard. Usually, company values are backed up by some additional layer of
incentive, such as annual awards for best demonstrating them, or use of the
values directly in regular performance reviews.

For values to work, however, they really need to be:

* **Few.** More than three or four company values and nobody will remember them
  all.
  
* **Short.** If the value is more than a couple of words, it's not a value, it's
  a rule (though it's OK for values to have descriptions to clarify their
  meaning for newcomers).
   
* **Practical.** If values can't be used to make decisions, they won't steer
  behaviors.
  
An example of a *good company value* is this one from American Express: "Good
Citizenship: we are good citizens in the communities in which we live and work."

The value itself is short, only two words. Its meaning is clear; the descriptive
text simply clarifies that it is inclusive of environments both inside and
outside of work. It can be used to make decisions, because any action is either
demonstrating good citizenship or it is not.

On the other hand, here are the values of a large financial firm: "Colleagues,
Customers, Company, Community."

They're certainly short, and alliterative to boot, but *they aren't values*!
This is just a list of groups of people. This doesn't help anyone make
decisions, and quite honestly, I'm not even sure what these "values" are
supposed to mean.

If you work for a company that has "bad" values, consider how you can interpret
them for your teams so they can be used to make decisions. Or, perhaps better
yet, define your own set of values for your teams and recognize people who
demonstrate them.
