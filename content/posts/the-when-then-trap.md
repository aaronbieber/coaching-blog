As heard on the Elevate podcast.

A default state of mind, in our commercialized and transactionalized world, is
that we'll be able to have, or feel, or do the thing that we most want just as
soon as we have bought or achieved some *other thing*.

There are two types of when/then: there's one where the WHEN is an
accomplishment, and another in which the WHEN is a purchase. Both are insidious
and false.

There is a THEN that is a feeling, and a THEN that is an ability or new option.

WHEN I buy this new Kindle, THEN I'll read more. (Hello, new Paperwhite).

WHEN I double my salary, THEN I can say I've "arrived" in life.
