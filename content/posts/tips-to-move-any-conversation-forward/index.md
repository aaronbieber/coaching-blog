As a member of the "leadership team" at the various companies I've worked for, a
lot of my job was talking to people. Leads of other teams, engineers, "senior
management," and so forth.

Most of the time, those conversations went just fine, but occasionally we'd get
*stuck*. There are two important ways in which a conversation can get stuck,
and I call them "the logjam" and "the loop."

It's frustrating for anyone to feel like the conversation isn't going anywhere,
and sometimes that leads to conflict and distraction from solving the problem
everyone came to solve, so here are my coaching-inspired tips for moving *any*
conversation forward.

## Recognize the challenge

As with most things, the first step to getting to where you want to go is
knowing exactly where you are. Learning to become aware of "halting conditions"
in conversation is how you will know what next step to take.

### "The logjam"

When you're in *the logjam*, you are stuck, blocked, at an impasse. You may
recognize this as actual silence, language of futility ("I don't see how that's
possible," or "that would never work"), or even the start of an argument.

The key thing to note here is that all forms of logjam are impediments to
progress. Whether what you're discussing is actually possible or not, simply
saying "that's impossible" doesn't solve any problems; it doesn't reveal more
information nor does it present solutions.

### "The loop"

The loop is also called *being in high-spin*, *talking in circles*, etc. The
primary characteristic of the loop is that the same ideas are repeated, or the
same themes are revisited, again and again, with different words.

The key thing to note here is that being in high-spin *can feel good.* For
instance, when discussing the viaiblity of an idea, it can be easy to fall into
a loop of just commiserating about the chronically broken or inefficient ways in
which the company works rather than facing the realities of solving the problems
at hand.

## Strategies to move forward

When you're in a *logjam*, you can use some techniques from coaching to raise
awareness about the situation and find a different path to take to get out of
the bind.

You can start with a broadening intro, like "let's take a step back from the
details for a minute," then try a classic open-ended question. An *open-ended
question* is one that *cannot* be answered by "yes" or "no." In some cases,
neither you nor the person you're talking to even *knows* the answer to the
question.

Here are some of my favorites:

* "What would so-and-so (this could be anyone) think about this?" You might try a
  mutually respected colleague, or get fun with it and name a famous CEO or
  athlete.
  
* "In six months from now, assume that we have this all figured out. What did we
  do?" Sometimes looking from the future back to the present puts enough
  distance between you and the problem to see something new.

* "What would it look like to do things entirely differently?" The goal with
  this one is to break down assumptions.

* "Maybe we can't see the path from here, so what would it look like from a
  helicopter?" Perspective-shifting questions can take many forms, so pick
  something that feels natural to you. Helicopter, submarine, through the eyes
  of a time traveler, it doesn't matter, get creative!

The purpose of this type of question is to *radically change your perspective*
on a problem. Usually when a problem appears to be intractable, it's because
everyone is looking through a specific lens that they're comfortable with.

You have to get uncomfortable to find an answer.

If you observe that you're in *high-spin* or *talking in circles*, the above
open-ended questions could be one way to proceed, but more often the ground is
getting re-tread because someone in the conversation has an ax to grind.

At some level, everyone has an ax to grind about something. The first step is to
recognize if you're the one doing the ax-grinding and gently redirect the
conversation toward outcomes. If it's someone else grinding their ax, we can
turn to more classical negotiation tactics.

The best negotiation book in my opinion is [Never Split the Difference][nstd] by former
FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss.

Based on Voss' writing, the best way out of conflict is *building trust* and
*gathering information*.

 - Listen closely
 - Repeat/mirror words and body langauge
 - Watch your tone
 - Acknowledge and label emotion

Typically once you let someone "empty their bucket," you'll see a dramatic shift
in their willingness to get out of that loop and help find the way forward.

While [Never Split the Difference][nstd] is still, in my opinion, the best
tactical guide to navigating an adversarial negotiation, a lot of the techniques
Voss talks about are also central to coaching.

Listening actively, noticing and describing what is happening, and accepting
what is said without judgment are all core coaching concepts that create a
productive and courageous space for solutions to be found.

stuck," I'd love to hear from you.
