Let's say you want your workers to be more productive. As the leader of a large
and complex organization, there are numerous levers that you could pull... But
which ones will improve the work output?

As it turns out, the answer is none of them. Or all of them.

<!--more-->

Worker productivity has always been of interest. It is self-evident that if you
can get employees to produce more by changing some simple parameters of the work
environment, that is "free money" in effect.

Not only has productivity been of interest to business owners, but also the
National Research Council (which is part of the National Academies of Science,
Engineering, and Medicine). So, they designed an experiment.

I'll let the amazing historian and presenter James Burke explain it, excerpted
from his BBC miniseries "[Connections 2][conn]."

These experiments took place at the Western Electric Hawthorne Plant in Cicero,
Illinois in the 1920s and '30s. You can easily look this up and read all about
them (much has been written).

Although the experiments resulted in spurious conclusions that have been
discredited by some (the so-called "Hawthorne effect"), what psychologists and
sociologists all seem to agree on is that people perform better with feedback
(the more specific and immediate the better), and when they are seen and heard.

So, if you want your people to be happier and work harder: listen to them, and
talk to them.

The more you hear their concerns, observe their challenges, and explain exactly
why everything is happening and why it matters, the more productive everyone
will be.

That isn't to say that the work environment is irrelevant to productivity. Quite
to the contrary, the open office plan is an abject failure[^1] of environment
design, and that's only one very visible example.

The point is that being open to feedback, and providing feedback, form the very
foundation of any successful and thriving organization. Without those tools in
place, it doesn't much matter whether the light levels, rest periods, conference
room equipment, or whiteboard sizes are "just right."

So before you dive into environment changes for your teams... Maybe talk to them
first.

## Questions for you

1. What might change if you explicitly asked for feedback regularly?

2. How do you recognize whether any communication to your teams has all the
   necessary context included?
   
3. What could you do to help your teams to feel seen and heard this week?
