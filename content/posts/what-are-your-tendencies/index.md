Do you know enough about yourself to lead with confidence?

Great managers are curious. Curiosity leads to new awareness, which leads to
opportunity, which ultimately leads to success. People with more self-awareness
perform better at their jobs, get more promotions, and lead more
effectively[^1].

Today I'll offer the first of many tools for improving your self-awareness: The
Four Tendencies.

How our happiness in life is tangled up in how we perceive ourselves and react
to different situations is deserving of a separate and much longer post, but I
believe that the more we know about who we are in our "natural state," the more
effective we'll be at setting ourselves up for success.

Gretchen Rubin is a New York Times bestselling author and speaker who has spent
a decade researching and writing about happiness. Rubin believes that happiness
can only be built "on the foundation of our own nature, our own values, and our
own interests."

Rubin created The Four Tendencies to help surface *why we act* and *why we don't
act*. By understanding which of the Tendencies is dominant for you, you can
adapt your circumstances to suit your nature.

Each Tendency is a discrete combination of how you meet external expectations
versus internal expectations. As with all of these "personality profile" tools,
it's very important to remember that how you show up is neither *good* nor
*bad*.

Rather, understanding the way you are naturally, without any extra effort,
allows you to structure your world in a way that guarantees success for your
natural self. It also helps you to stay aware of times when more effort is
required to overcome your "default settings," if necessary.

I'm an Obliger. Obligers "meet outer expectations, but struggle to meet
expectations they impose on themselves---'You can count on me; and I'm counting
on you to count on me'."

While the Four Tendencies assessment is rather course and can't begin to capture
the wealth of nuance and subtlety in any whole person, it's true that I'm more
likely to wriggle out of the expectations I set for myself.

I'm allergic to letting people down, and I'll always go the extra mile for
everyone (even if they objectively don't deserve it). My weakness is in showing
that same degree of loyalty to myself.

Knowing this helps me to create my own tailored environment for success.

I work better with accountability, so I got an "accountabilibuddy" to meet with
me once a week to compare notes on the things we're each working toward, and to
ask me the tough questions about what I left incomplete or unsaid.

Creating accountability for myself is facing my natural way of being head-on,
and structuring the way I work to accommodate it. I don't expect that I'll
magically become more disciplined about keeping my promises to myself, but this
awareness creates opportunity for me to *build* an environment for success.

As a leader, your core responsibility is to create an environment for success to
emerge and thrive within your teams. That environment is a confluence of norms,
cultural ideals, incentives, and the specific humans who inhabit it.

By doing the important *inner work* necessary to build self-awareness, you can
create that environment for yourself. From there, you will have the
requisite understanding and experience to create a thriving team environment as
well.
