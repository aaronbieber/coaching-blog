The best work is done by teams who, frankly, *give a shit* about what they're
doing. If your team is showing up just to get paid, you aren't getting the
optimal results, period.

That doesn't mean you need teams of single-minded idealists who exalt the team
and company's mission and would walk over hot coals without question if
asked. Rather, it means *you*, their *manager*, need to connect their work to *a
purpose greater than them*.

In today's issue: how do you do that?

Queen Elizabeth II died on September 8th, 2022 after a reign of 70 years and 214
days. At 17:31 UTC on that day, reputable news sources started reporting on her
death.

At 17:32 UTC, Wikipedia editor "Sydwhunte" updated the Queen Elizabeth II page
to reflect her death. Their change was the first of a *flurry* of edit conflicts
on that page.

![Edit conflicts graph](/uploads/whats-really-important/edit-conflicts.jpg) 

The page was edited more than *55 times over the next 15 minutes* as editors
changed verbs to past tense, updated the infobox, and so on. A "task force"
formed, calling themselves "WikiProject London Bridge," specifically to
undertake the "updates required due to the death and succession of Elizabeth II,
and the accession of Charles III."

It started as six people and now has *20 people* on board.

We are reminded by [depths of wikipedia][fun]
that:

The only reason anyone does more than the bare minimum at their job is that
there is *some intrinsic purpose* in the work for them.

In [Daniel Pink's book, *Drive*][drive], he calls it "motivation 3.0."

The idea stems from [Maslow's hierarchy of needs][maslow]. "Motivation 1.0" is
the need for money to buy food and shelter, and "motivation 2.0" is incentives
described as "the carrot and the stick."

The carrot might be recognition, promotion, or a bonus. The stick might be a
PIP, or being removed from a team or project, or the risk of getting fired.

But it's "motivation 3.0" that gets a Wikipedia editor like [Pi.1415926535][pi]
to submit over 35,000 edits to (mostly) Boston MBTA transit pages over the
course of 16 years. They do it because to them, *it's important*.

If you could build an engine inside of a person like that, and inspire them to
contribute, I have no doubt that they would surprise and impress you.

Connecting someone's work to its purpose is what James Robbins calls *the second
paycheck* in his book [Nine Minutes on Monday][nmom] (one of my favorite
practical management books).

Whether folks on your teams understand what their work is contributing to or
not, it is your job as their manager to explicitly *identify the connection* of
their work to the purpose; to give them their second paycheck.

To do it, Robbins suggests answering three questions:

### Whom do we serve?

Who is the beneficiary of the team's or company's work? How detailed a picture
can you help to paint of who is benefiting? Are there opportunities for your
team members to have direct interactions with customers? Read their feedback?
Observe focus groups?
   
### What have we been hired to do?

Go one step deeper than the product or service. I worked for Wayfair, which
sells furniture and home decor products, but just selling lots of end tables
isn't the *reason* the company exists. The deeper purpose is to help people
"have a home they love."

### How do you make a difference?

Finally, help your team member see the straight line from the work they're
doing, no matter how seemingly trivial, to fulfilling the purpose for the
customer, or to the team, or to you as their manager.

Show them how their work makes others' lives better.

Deliver the second paycheck through an actual conversation (whether verbal,
email, or Slack, it doesn't matter). Connect their work to its purpose, and
ideally do this for specific work efforts, using detailed language.

## Questions for you

1. What part of your job is important to you? Who do you serve?

2. How will you connect your team's work to a purpose this week?

3. Think of a time that you put effort into something without being paid for
   it. What was the *real* payoff for you?
