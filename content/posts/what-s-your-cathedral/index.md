One of my favorite topics is culture and incentives, which I've
[written][culture] about [before][important]. Culture is the name we give to all
the behavior of a group, which is mainly influenced by incentives.

[important]: {{< ref "what-s-really-important" >}}
[culture]: {{< ref "creating-a-culture" >}}

Part of your job as a leader is to create the culture by aligning values,
incentives, and your own behavior. But when it comes to getting the day-to-day
work done, ordinary incentives aren't always enough.

That's where the cathedral comes in.

This passage from Simon Sinek's book "[Start with Why][ss]" stuck with me:

[ss]: https://amzn.to/3uYq17W

> Consider the story of two stonemasons.  You walk up to the first stonemason
> and ask, "Do you like your job?"  He looks up at you and replies, "I've been
> building this wall for as long as I can remember.  The work is monotonous.  I
> work in the scorching hot sun all day.  The stones are heavy and lifting them
> day after day can be backbreaking.  I'm not even sure if this project will be
> completed in my lifetime.  But it's a job.  It pays the bills." You thank him

> About thirty feet away you walk up to a second stonemason.  You ask him the
> same question, "Do you like your job?"  He looks up and replies, "I love my
> job.  I'm building a cathedral.  Sure, Iâ€™ve been working on this wall for as
> long as I can remember and yes, the work is sometimes monotonous.  I work in
> the scorching hot sun all day.  The stones are heavy and lifting them day
> after day can be backbreaking.  I'm not even sure if this project will be

What I love about this is how well it illustrates the difference between a
"transactional relationship" to work and a "mission-oriented relationship" to
work.

I've previously [warned about passion at work][passion], and I still believe
it's a bad idea to get emotionally tied up in your job. At the same time, the
best motivation to do awesome work is to have some greater purpose.

[passion]: {{< ref "passion-for-your-job-is-a-mistake" >}}

It can become dangerous for you, the employee, if your purpose becomes an
obsession, but purpose by itself is a valuable tool.

The first stonemason in the story looks at his job as transactional. He performs
work, which he finds grueling, and he is paid money. The money is enough to make
the toil bearable.

The second stonemason looks at his job as an honor. The outcome of his work,
which he admits he may not live to see, is *worthwhile* in his eyes. He doesn't
even mention the money, because the money isn't the point.

This is the same reason one Wikipedia editor has [submitted over 35,000 edits][mbta]
to Boston transit system pages over the last 16 years. Nobody gets paid to
update Boston transit system pages. They do it because, to them, it's important.

There's one crucial detail to take note of. The scale and impact of the purpose
is irrelevant. Only its importance to the individual matters.

While the second stonemason is moved to be contributing to a magnificent
structure of cultural and religious gravity, the Wikipedia editor's labor is
poured into something substantially less visible or grand. What matters is what
it means to you.

It isn't even necessary for the practical outcome of the work to meet any
criteria; some people are motivated to contribute because it provides personal
growth, results in acknowledgment, or allows them to create value within a team
they respect and enjoy working with.

By discovering the value each person finds in their work, or helping them to
find it, and simply reminding them periodically how what they're doing connects
to that, you will create an unstoppable force.

## Questions for you

1. What are each of your team members' "cathedrals?"

2. What is *your* cathedral?

3. How will you connect each of your team member's work to their purpose this
   week?
